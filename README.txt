I have completed the bonus

This program will read input from a text file and create a Binary Search Tree with the data. It will then output to
two files. The first file will contain the data fields in chronological order. The second file will contain elements as they
appear in the tree from top to bottom, left to right.

Compile by: javac TestingBinaryTree.java BinaryTree.java Queue.java TreeNode.java

Run the program by: java TestingBinaryTree input.txt first_output_file.txt second_output_file.txt

**input.txt, first_output_file.txt and first_output_file.txt should be replaced with chosen files for input and output
**input files must go in the "input" folder which will be included in the package
